# CloudUnit developpement environment

You are reading the wright guide, if you want to setup an environment to contribute to CloudUnit development.

## Requirements

* A MacOSX computer
* Vagrant 1.7.8+
* Git / Java 1.8
* Node 5.x
* VirtualBox 5.0.4+
* Maven 3
 
## Architecture sources

* `cloudunit/cu-manager`  : Maven project 
* `cloudunit/cu-plaform`  : Shell scripts for administration 
* `cloudunit/cu-services` : Docker images

## Dev Rules

* You have to configure a local dns (see further) to send any requests from your host to VM (IP fixed at 192.168.50.4) 
* A reverse proxy is included into vagrantbox to route the request (*.cloudunit.dev) to the right app.
* You use your favorite idea (intellij, Eclipse) to develop the maven project into 'cloudunit/cu-manager'.
* The backend is a spring application exposing a REST API
* The frontend is an AngularJS 1.x consuming the backend API
* You run the project with an embedded tomcat via maven tasks (tomcat:run). No need to install Tomcat locally.
* Mysql is included into vagrantbox so no need to install it locally.

## Installation 

### Local DNS

CloudUnit uses Docker and Java but others components. 
As pre-requisites, you need to install them to have a complete dev stack. 
You need to install a local DNS for entry.
```
Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder 
and DHCP server [â€¦] is targeted at home networks[.]
```
You need to add a local DNS entry pointing to the vagrant IP address. More precisely, any address ending with .cloudunit.dev shoud point to `192.168.50.4`. On Ubuntu, a simple way to achieve this is to install dnsmasq:

Update your homebrew installation
```
brew up
```

Install dnsmasq
```
brew install dnsmasq
```

Copy the configuration.
```
mkdir /usr/local/etc
cp /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/dnsmasq.conf.example /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

Then edit the file `/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf` and add the line:
```
address=/cloudunit.dev/192.168.50.4
```

Create the directory
```
sudo mkdir /etc/resolver
```
Then add the following file
```
sudo vi /etc/resolver/dev
vi /etc/resolver/dev
```
Add the following line
```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
```

Finally, start dnsmasq:
```
$ sudo launchctl start homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq
```
For more information in this environment, please read this [article](http://passingcuriosity.com/2013/dnsmasq-dev-osx/)

### Installation NPM

Mac Users are invited to follow the instructions given by the [npm website](https://nodejs.org)

### Source code installation

Follow these instructions
* `cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/Treeptik/CloudUnit.git`
* `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager/src/main/webapp && sudo npm install grunt -g`
* `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager/src/main/webapp && sudo npm install grunt-cli -g`
* `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager/src/main/webapp && sudo npm install bower -g`

## How to install Vagrant plugins
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

## How to start Environment Developpment

To run the UI for development (http://0.0.0.0:9000)
*  `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager/src/main/webapp && vagrant up dev`
*  `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager/src/main/webapp && grunt serve`
*  `cd $HOME/CloudUnit/cu-manager`
*  `mvn clean compile tomcat7:run -DskipTests -Dspring.profiles.active=vagrant`

## How to reset Environment Developpment

```
cd $HOME/CloudUnit
vagrant ssh dev
cloudunit/cu-platform/reset-all.sh -y
```
