# CloudUnit server installation

You are reading the wright guide if you want to setup a CloudUnit server, in order to frequently use it. 

## Requirements

* A server with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS with a 3.13 or 3.19 kernel. Ok for 4.x
* Git installed and a root account

```No mysql server because it is provided by docker.  If present, you must save your data and remove it. ```
